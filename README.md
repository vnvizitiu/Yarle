### YARLE - Yet Anothre Random LINQ Extension

[NuGet page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/org.flamerat.Yarle/)

This is a collection of LINQ functions that I dreamed of having, and now I don't have to dream.

All the functions are coded in a way to make use of LINQ as much as possible, thus hopefully
it's efficient.

I hope that this is useful, but I can't guarantee.

The document might be quite poor, if that's the case, I recommend taking a look at the source code and/or send me a pull request.

If you consider that there are some features I should include, feel free to send me a pull request or create an issue.
